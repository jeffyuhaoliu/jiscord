Note added to `jiscord-eul.1`. The task is **stuck/blocked**:

- `bd start` is not a valid command (no such subcommand in this bd version)
- Scaffold is already complete and committed (`0df437c`) — all required files exist in `apps/web/`
- `bd close` is blocked by open dependency `jiscord-d1h.8` (Gateway self-review)

**Next action**: Resolve `jiscord-d1h.8` first, then this task can be closed.
