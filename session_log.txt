Task `jiscord-d1h.1` is closed. The gateway service at `services/gateway/` was already fully scaffolded with:

- `Fastify` + `ws` + `ioredis` on port 3002
- `GET /health` → `{status:'ok', connections: N}` (returns 200)
- WebSocket upgrade on the same HTTP server port
- Redis pub/sub with separate publisher/subscriber clients
- Heartbeat monitor with HELLO + HEARTBEAT_ACK protocol
- docker-compose entry already configured
- `.gitignore`, `Dockerfile`, `tsconfig.json` all present and committed
