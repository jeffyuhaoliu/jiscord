**Epic: Identity — Complete**

Here's what was implemented:

**`services/auth-service/`** (port 3003, new service):
- `GET /health` — always returns `{status: 'ok'}`
- `POST /register` — validates username (2–32 chars), email format, password (≥8 chars); bcrypt cost=12; proxies user creation to data-service; returns `{user_id, username}`; 409 on duplicate email
- `POST /login` — fetches user via data-service, bcrypt compare, signs HS256 JWT (7d expiry) with `{sub, username}`; returns `{token, user}`; uniform 401 on any failure (no info leak)
- `GET /me` — fastify-jwt `preHandler` guard, returns current user from data-service
- `POST /verify-token` — internal endpoint for Gateway to validate tokens; returns `{sub, username}` or 401

**`services/data-service/`** additions:
- `UserRepository` — DataLoader-coalesced batch fetching by user_id, email lookup via `users_by_email` table, `createUser` writes both tables
- New routes: `POST /users`, `GET /users/:id`, `GET /users/email/:email`

**`docker-compose.yml`** — auth-service added on port 3003 with `DATA_SERVICE_URL` and `JWT_SECRET` env; gateway updated with `AUTH_SERVICE_URL`

Both services compile cleanly (`tsc` exit 0). Committed as `de12999`.
