It seems write permissions may be restricted. Please grant permission for this edit — I need to modify `UserRepository.ts` to rename `getUserById` to `batchGetById(ids: string[])` and update `createUser` to accept a data object. These are the exact fixes described in the blocked comments.

Once you grant permission, here's what I'll do:

1. **`getUserById(userId: string)`** → **`batchGetById(ids: string[])`** — calls `userLoader.loadMany(ids)` instead of `load`
2. **`createUser(username, email, passwordHash)`** → **`createUser(data: { username, email, passwordHash })`** — accepts a single object

Would you like to approve the edit?
