The scaffold is complete — I need your approval to run `npm install`. The web app at `apps/web/` already has:

- `vite.config.ts` with proxy: `/api/auth → :3002`, `/api/data → :3001`, `/ws → :3000` (WebSocket)
- `package.json` with React 19 + Vite 6 + TypeScript
- `.gitignore` with `node_modules/` and `dist/`
- Entry point `index.html`, `src/main.tsx`, `src/App.tsx`

Please approve the `npm install` command above to install dependencies. Once that runs, I'll verify TypeScript compiles and finish the task.
