Comment logged. The task is stuck due to:

1. `bd start`, `bd finish`, and `bd note` do not exist in this version of `bd`
2. The scaffold (apps/web/) is already complete and committed (`0df437c`)
3. `bd close` is blocked by open dependency **jiscord-d1h.8** (Gateway self-review)

**Status**: No action possible until `jiscord-d1h.8` is resolved. Comment added to `jiscord-eul.1` documenting the situation.
