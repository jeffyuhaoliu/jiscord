`bd close` is blocked by the open dependency `jiscord-d1h.8` (Gateway self-review). The scaffold itself is verified complete — `vite.config.ts` has the correct proxies (`/api/auth → 3002`, `/api/data → 3001`), and all source files are in place. Added a comment to `jiscord-eul.1` documenting this status. The task will be closeable once `jiscord-d1h.8` is resolved.
