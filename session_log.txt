It looks like there's a pending permission prompt in the UI that needs your approval before I can write files to the new `services/frontend/` directory. Please look for a permission dialog/prompt asking if Claude can write to `/Users/jeff/projects/jiscord/services/frontend/.gitignore` and click **Allow** (or "Allow all" to approve all writes for this session).

Once you approve, I'll continue scaffolding the entire frontend application.
