`bd start` and `bd finish` commands do not exist in this version of `bd`. Per rule 3 (failure/stuck), I logged the situation via `bd comments add jiscord-eul.1` with detailed context:

- `bd start` → unknown command
- `bd finish` → unknown command  
- `bd note` → unknown command
- Scaffold is already complete and committed (`0df437c`)
- Task remains blocked by open dependency `jiscord-d1h.8` (Gateway self-review)
