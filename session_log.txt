Done. Here's a summary of what was implemented:

**`MessageRepository.ts`** — rewritten to match the task spec:
- `insertMessage({ channel_id, author_id, content })` — uses CQL `now()` to generate a server-side `timeuuid` for `message_id`, keeping timestamp generation consistent and collision-free
- `getByChannel({ channel_id, pageState?, limit? })` — returns `{ messages, nextPageState }` using the cassandra-driver's native paging state (no OFFSET, no keyset cursor hand-rolling)

**`index.ts`** — updated:
- `GET /channels/:channelId/messages` now delegates to `getByChannel` (query param renamed `pageSize` → `limit` to match the repo interface)
- `POST /channels/:channelId/messages` added, backed by `insertMessage`, returning `201` on success
