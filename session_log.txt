Here is the final review summary and what was done:

## Code Review Results

| Component | Result | Issues Fixed | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| data-service | ⚠️ Max iterations | 1 | password_hash exposure resolved via dedicated `verify-password` endpoint |
| auth-service | ✅ Approved | 1 | Hardcoded `JWT_SECRET` fallback removed; startup now fails fast |
| gateway | ✅ Approved | 0 | No issues found |
| web-frontend | ⚠️ Max iterations | 2 | WebSocket relative URL fixed; heartbeat timer leak fixed; reviewer's 3rd-pass "double body read" was a false positive (branches are mutually exclusive) |
| types-and-migrations | ✅ Approved | 0 | All interfaces match CQL schemas; verify-password integration confirmed correct |

## Epic jiscord-l2t — Completed

All 9 child issues closed and committed. Summary of what was built:

**Backend (data-service):**
- `GuildRepository.getAll()` + `GET /guilds` — guild browser
- `POST /guilds` — create guild with creator auto-membership (LOGGED BATCH)
- `POST /guilds/:guildId/members` — join guild
- `POST /guilds/:guildId/channels` — create channel
- `POST /users/email/:email/verify-password` — bcrypt runs server-side, password hash never travels the wire

**Backend (auth-service):**
- Login delegates to `verify-password` instead of fetching the hash locally
- `JWT_SECRET` is now required at startup (no silent insecure default)

**Frontend:**
- GuildSidebar: **+** creates a server, **🔍** opens the guild browser with join buttons
- ChannelList: **+** opens an inline channel name input
- WebSocket URL fixed from relative `/ws` to absolute `ws(s)://host/ws`
- Heartbeat timer now starts after `READY` (not `HELLO`) and is stored in a ref to prevent leaks

**Dev tooling:**
- `npm run seed` in `services/data-service` — idempotent script that creates `demo@example.com` / `password123`, a "General" guild, and a "general" channel
- `GETTING_STARTED.md` fully updated: seed instructions replace the manual `cqlsh` steps
