Comment logged. Exiting per Rule 4.

**Summary:**
- `bd start jiscord-eul.1` — FAILED (`start` command does not exist)
- `bd note jiscord-eul.1` — FAILED (`note` command does not exist)
- Logged stuck state via `bd comments add jiscord-eul.1` (Rule 3 equivalent)

**Status:** Task `jiscord-eul.1` scaffold is already complete (committed at `0df437c`). Blocked from closing by open dependency `jiscord-d1h.8` (Gateway self-review). No action possible until that dependency resolves.
