I've hit a blocking situation. Here's the summary:

**What exists:** `UserRepository.ts` has the correct DataLoader architecture — batches `SELECT ... WHERE user_id IN ?`, `getUserByEmail` routes through the loader (satisfies "DataLoader is the ONLY path"), and `createUser` does dual-write to `users` + `users_by_email`.

**What's missing (API spec gaps):**
1. `getUserById(userId: string)` should be `batchGetById(ids: string[])` using `loadMany`
2. `createUser(username, email, passwordHash)` should be `createUser(data: { username, email, password_hash })`

**Why blocked:** All 5 attempts to edit `UserRepository.ts` were denied by the permission system.

To unblock: please grant write permission to `services/data-service/src/repositories/UserRepository.ts` and I'll make the two targeted API changes.
