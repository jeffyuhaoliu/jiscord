Done. The two API fixes applied to `UserRepository.ts`:

1. `getUserById(userId: string)` → `batchGetById(ids: string[])` — now uses `loadMany` to expose batch-oriented API
2. `createUser(username, email, passwordHash)` → `createUser(data: { username, email, passwordHash })` — accepts a data object

TypeScript compiled clean and the issue is closed.
